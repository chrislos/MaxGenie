# MaxGenie
This patch wraps the recently updated excellent version of google's Magenta Piano-Genie by Chris Donahue, Ian Simon, Sander Dieleman and Monica Dinculescu into MaxMSP via NodeJS. It's a very rudamentary "proof of concept".

The example should work offline. All the npm packages and rnn-model-weights have been loaded in advance.
If I find the time I'll add some functionality. 

# Instructions 
open MaxGenie.maxpat and you should basically good to go.
